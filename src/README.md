 This source code was originally 'leaked' by 'JaySmith2000' in August 2008,
 who sold it on CD as part of a release entitled the 'Jaguar Sector II Source Code
 Collection':
  https://web.archive.org/web/20131117222232/http://www.jaysmith2000.com/Jagpriceguide.htm

 This is a cleaned-up and commented version of the source code file 'yakgpu.s'.

 No code has been changed, so these source files can be used to create a build
 of Tempest 2000 that is byte-for-byte identical to the original 1994 release.
